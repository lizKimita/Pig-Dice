      <h1>Pig Dice</h1>
        <h2>Rules of the game!</h2>
        <p>Number of players required to play the game: 2</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For each player's round, one can roll the die as many times as they want.</li>
          <li>The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die.</li>
          <li>If a player rolls a 1 on the die, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated so far are forfeited.</li>
          <li>A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points.</li>
          <li>If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score, and the next player takes a turn.</li>
          <li>THe first player to reach a total of 100 points wins the game and the game ends.</li>
        </ul>
