## Description
The pig dice game can best be explained using its rules:
* For each player's round, one can roll the die as many times as they want.
* The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible, adding up the numbers rolled on the die.
* If a player rolls a 1 on the die, the player's turn is over and any points they have accumulated so far are forfeited.
* A player can also choose to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of rolling a 1 and losing all of their points.
* If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are added to his or her score, and the next player takes a turn.
* The first player to reach a total of 100 points wins the game and the game ends.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* The user requires an Internet connection to log into the website.
* After logging into the Pig Dice site, both players are required to enter their names to start the game
* The players should then come across a set of rules for the game, they should go through them so as to understand how to play and what to expect from the game.
* They can the start playing and the results for each round and the total will show up.
